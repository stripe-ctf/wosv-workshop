# Level 3

After the fiasco back in Level 0, management has decided to fortify the Secret
Safe into an unbreakable solution (kind of like
[Unbreakable Linux](http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/linux/ubreakable-enterprise-kernel-linux-173350.html))
The resulting product is Secret Vault, which is so secure that it requires
human intervention to add new secrets.

A beta version has launched with some interesting secrets
(including the password to access Level 4).
